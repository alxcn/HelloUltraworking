  Hi, my name is Manuel Alejandro Ucan Puc..

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I have a mathematics Ph.D. from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México under the supervision of Dr. Jose Seade and Dr. Angel Cano, with a thesis on complex Klenian group theory. 

My field of research correspond to dynamical systems, geometry and topology, with particular interests on actions of discrete groups, Kleinian group theory, (complex) projective geometry, and geometric group theory.

Currently I'm a independent resercher based on Mexico, previously I was a postdoc position by CONACyT (Mex) at the Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche under the supervision of Prof. Elisha Falbel. 

My current project is related to the study of complex projective structures on special manifolds (like links' complements, Deligne-Mostow lattices quotients). 

I have programming skills on Python (good), SageMath (good), LaTeX (good), SQL (basic), and R (basic). Some of my programming projects are the McMullen's algorithm for complex Schottky groups (based on the Newton algorithm to find roots of a function), and the study of representation varieties of Deligne-Mostow lattices (solve of polynomial systems using Groebner basis and extensions of the rationals). 

Outside academia, my main interest is poetry and popular sciences, I have a blog called i.rracionalx where I post my own poetry creations inspired on math concepts. Other of my interest are  digital drawing, fictional writing, cooking, and photographie.
